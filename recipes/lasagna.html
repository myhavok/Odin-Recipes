        <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat oven to 350°. Brown beef and Italian sausage in a large pan. Drain of fat. With the Italian sausage, I usually press on it with a paper towel too.</li>
        <li>Add spaghetti sauce to pan. Add spices to pan. Stir well, and set on a very low simmer.</li>
        <li>Boil a large pot of water. Sprinkle in a little salt and a dash of olive oil. Drop lasagna into boiling water. Cook until not quite done. (It will cook more in the oven and stiffer pasta is easier to work with). Lay out pasta on large towel</li>
        <li>Spray a large 9” x 13” pan with non-stick spray. (or grease very lightly).</li>
        <li>Set up lasagna making station: 1) pot of meat/sauce [divide into 4 if you’re worried about judging amounts]; 2) noodles; 3) cottage cheese; 4) mozzarella cheese; 5) parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover bottom of pan with thin layer of sauce/meat</li>
        <li>Cover with one layer of noodles. Smear sauce on top of the noodles. Spread 1/2 of cottage cheese. Sprinkle 1/3 of mozzarella and 1/3 of Parmesan over this.</li>
        <li>Repeat above step.</li>
        <li>Cover with one layer of noodles. Spoon rest of sauce over the noodles. Sprinkle last third of mozzarella over everything. Sprinkle last third Parmesan over everything.</li>
        <li>Bake at 350° for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until lightly browned and bubbly. (Allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving).</li>
    
    </ol>
